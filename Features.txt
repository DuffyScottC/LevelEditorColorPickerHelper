merge projects

generate only a text file with the array elements, not the whole script

Allow users to specify for a given project that images are not to be copied, but instead linked to (to save space)

Make the list items show the color instead of white, so that users who have different colored entities with the same grey-scale drawing can visually tell the difference.

Make a color picker that allows the user to pick a color from, at least, the image associated with the entity.

Warn the user that they MUST follow this procedure for their image importing:
Advanced: Read/Write Enabled = true
Filter Mode = Point (No filter)
Default: Compression = none
